There once was a sponge named Bob that lived on Mars. Bob worked at the meat processing plant.

Meat processing was a big industry on Mars, since it's rather hard to grow
crops and raise animals, so the most nutrition possible must be extracted
from any and all sources.

Bob took advantage of the capitalist society on Mars and worked his way up the
chain to the position of managing partner of the plant.

On one day, Bob's boss gave him a quest: double the efficiency of the plant
or he will face unemployment. Bob was in a hard time.
